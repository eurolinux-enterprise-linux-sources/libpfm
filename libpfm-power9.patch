Subject: [PATCH 1/6] Enable IBM Power9 core PMU support (beta)

This patch is build tested only, thus the [RFC] tag. :-)
The event list itself is untested and thus subject to change.

Add POWER9 support.

Subject: [PATCH 5/6] power9 event list update for perfmon2

Updated ppc64/Power9 event list.

Updated event list. (Jun 2017).  Significant updates
here with respect to the preliminary list that was posted
back in January.  I've made this sorted alphabetically,
with the expectation future updates (if any) will be
less noisy.
